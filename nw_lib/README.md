# nw_lib
--==native_world_library==--\n
This project is probably my "std namespace" for most purposes.
Here I use alias for standard names, define own types and make simple classes.
--==parts_of_the_library==--\n
This project contains many various names but the most important are
"memory", "math" because these are starting points of the library and
they are used pretty much everywhere in my other projects.
